# sdcc-cpm-diskdump

This program is designed for the Xerox 820 with 2 8" SSDD floppy drives.

It reads the "B" drive in physical sector order, dumping an ixex-style
listing to the printer port at 19200 with no handshaking.

This output can be received on a host computer and used under CPM
emulators or with cpmtools cpmls/cpmcp/etc.

This comes without any warranty.
